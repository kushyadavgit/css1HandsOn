        <li  >
            Inline - by using the style attribute inside HTML elementsl</li>
        
            <li>Internal - by using a style element in the head section </li>
        
        <li>External - by using a link element to link to an external CSS file.</li>
        
        <li>The most common way to add CSS, is to 
        keep the styles in external CSS files. 
         However,<span class="mark"><b>in this tutorial we will use inline and internal styles</b></span>, because this is easier to demonstrate, and easierfor you to try it yourself.</li>
    </ul>




    <p class="p">When comparing CSS class vs ID, the difference is that CSS class applies a style to multiple elements. ID, on the other hand, applies a style to one unique element. ID is also special in that you can use a special URL to link directly to an element and it's used by JavaScript.</p>

    <p class="p">In CSS, selectors are used to target a specific element or range of elements on a web page. Once an element has been targeted, a style or set of styles can be applied to the element.</p>

    <p class="p">There is a wide range of selectors available. Two of the most commonly used are class and ID. Both are used to target elements to which a style should be applied.</p>
